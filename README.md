BIO708 work 
 
The data is absorption over time of in vitro highthroughput sequencing NADPH assay of different CYP1 proteins in vitro. CYP proteins work in chemical defence to breakdown the toxin. Each well of the plate were labeled with alphabetically rows and numerical columns with noted reagents. Different wells contained the desired protein, NADPH and reductase with the various different combinations to control for the changes in absorption of the individual components and combinations without proteins present. The goal of the data is to find target substrates for various cyp proteins in order to then use them in vivo with cyp knockout lines to see effects in the live organisms.
